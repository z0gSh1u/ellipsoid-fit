# Ellipsoid Fit

This is the [code](./ellipsoid_fit.py) and [report](ellipsoid-fitting.pdf) of our course work for ellipsoid and super-ellipsoid fitting of Geometrical Modelling. We deployed [Grammalidis'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/852337) method as the constraint for the ellipsoid, and [CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES) optimizer for the super-ellipsoid.
